# Tick-Tac-Toe
Simple Tick Tack Toe game in C++

# Afterthought
I orginately started this project because I thought it would be relatively quick but it turned out to be longer than expected! There are definately improvements that can be done to the structure of this code. So that's a good lesson to take from this project; it is to simple be organized because you never know how big a project is going to be until you start working on it.
